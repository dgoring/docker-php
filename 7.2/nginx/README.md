### note
This image has it's own fpm which runs on 127.0.0.1:9000
if you want to set your own you need to add the proxy in your host file
and set your fpm listener to a file or different port
```vhost
location ~ \.php\d?$ {
    try_files $uri =404;

    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8000;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME $fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi_params;
}

```

### Extending
Note the default user is `www-data` so you need to prefix commands with `sudo` i.e.
```conf
RUN sudo apt-get install package-name
```
